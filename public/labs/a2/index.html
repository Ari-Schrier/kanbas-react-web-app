            How can I laugh or cry
            When my mind is sorely torn?
            Badabec had to die
            Fair Pantagruel is born
            Shall I weep, yes, for why?
            Then laugh and show my scorn
            Born with a strength untold
            Foreseen to have great age
            Set in Gargantuan mould
            Joyful laugh, yet quick to rage
            Princely wisdom, habits bold
            Power, glory, lauded sage
            Pantagruel born - the Earth was dry and burning
            In Paradise - dear Badabec prays for him
            Pantagruel born - the Earth was dry and burning
            In Paradise - dear Badabec prays for him
            Pantagruel born - the Earth was dry and burning
            In Paradise - dear Badabec prays for him
            How can I laugh or cry
            When my mind is sorely torn?
            Badabec had to die
            Fair Pantagruel is born
            Shall I weep, yes, for why?
            Then laugh and show my scorn

            Sister bluebird flying high above
            Shine your wings forward to the sun
            Hide the mysteries of life on your way
            Though you've seen them, please don't say a word
            What you don't know, I have never heard
            Starship trooper, go sailing on by
            Catch my soul, catch the very light
            Hide the moment from my eager eye
            Though you've seen them, please don't tell a soul
            What you can't see, can't be very whole
            Speak to me of summer
            Long winters longer than time can remember
            The setting up of other roads
            To travel on in old accustomed ways
            I still remember the talks by the water
            The proud sons and daughter
            That knew the knowledge of the land
            Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways
            Mother life, hold firmly on to me
            Catch my knowledge higher than the day
            Lose as much as only you can show
            Though you've seen me, please don't say a word
            What I don't know, I have never shared
            Loneliness is a power that we possess to give or take away forever
            All I know can be shown by your acceptance of the facts there shown before you
            Take what I say in a different way and it's easy to say that this is all confusion
            As I see a new day in me, I can also show it you and you may follow
            Speak to me of summer
            Long winters longer than time can remember
            The setting up of other roads
            To travel on in old accustomed ways
            I still remember the talks by the water
            The proud sons and daughter
            That knew the knowledge of the land
            Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways
